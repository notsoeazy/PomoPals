# When Starting:
    source venv/bin/activate - enter virtual environment
    deactivate - leave virtual environment

# To run:
    # Automatically rebuilds when you change files (like HTML templates)
    npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./static/src/input.css -o ./static/dist/output.css --watch
    flask run


Original Plan: Make a flask app.

Current Plan: Make a static website that will run on github pages.
In consideration for the stats and profile. It will be stored on localStorage.

====================================

TODO:
    [] Profile sidebar design
    [] Profile close and open logic


    Bugs:
        [] Alarm doesnt play until alert() is closed
            - possible fix, make an alert modal
            - possible fix, make a system notification

    Fix:
        [] Fix the timer width, should be 90% of the screen.


    # Maybe when no longer using github pages
    For future:
        Make login possible
        username
        logout
        changepassword
        Add database.
        Store the stats in database.
        Add timer end modal. - make alarm sound loop or after a certain time.

    For consideration:
        Timer is active even when tab is not. (Implemented)
